# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Delaying formalizing the research question and problem statement.

- Excessive broad brainstorming before focusing on a specific problem.

- Over-reliance on general web searches for niche academic literature.

## Continue Doing

- Fostering a clear, focused research question to guide the study.
  
- Maintaining structured project organization with distinct sections.

- Conducting thorough background research for key concepts and insights.

- Emphasizing "Why Data Analysis Matters" to articulate our research's value.

- Highlighting notable case studies for real-world context and inspiration.

## Start Doing
  
- Creating a centralized repository for all collected resources and notes.

- Proactively identifying potential data sources and limitations earlier.

- Discussing potential methodologies during background research for feasibility.

## Lessons Learned

- A well-defined research question and problem statement are foundational.
  
- Structured brainstorming efficiently narrows problem spaces.
  
- Comprehensive background research is crucial for understanding the domain.
  
- Articulating the value of data analysis justifies the project's impact.

- Including real-world examples makes the research more relatable.

## Strategy vs. Board

## What parts of your plan went as expected?

- The convergent thinking process for problem selection was effective.

- Identifying key research objectives aligned with aims.

- Compiling essential crowdfunding concepts and Kickstarter overview went smoothly.

## What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Initial delays in solidifying research question phrasing required revisions.

- Underestimating the breadth of initial brainstorming extended the selection phase.

## Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- We added an explicit focus on "Why Data Analysis Matters" to clarify rationale.

- We incorporated specific notable case studies to illustrate successful campaigns.

## Or remove extra steps?

- We streamlined initial brainstorming documentation to focus on criteria and decisions.

## What went well during this project cycle?

- The team's ability effectively define and refine the research question was effective.

- The systematic approach to problem selection ensured a relevant project.

- Clear articulation of project goals set a strong direction.

- Justification for data analysis effectively highlighted the project's significance.
