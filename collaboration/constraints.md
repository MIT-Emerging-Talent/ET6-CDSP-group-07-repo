# Project Constraints

*Let’s keep it real so we can keep it rolling.*

## 📌 Purpose

Every successful project starts with clarity. This document outlines the
 key constraints—both external and internal—that could affect our workflow.
  By identifying these early, we can:

* Set realistic expectations
* Plan with flexibility
* Encourage transparency

Our goal is to stay aligned, support each other, and build something great—together.
