# Project Constraints

*Let’s keep it real so we can keep it rolling.*

---

## 📌 Purpose

Every successful project starts with clarity. This document outlines the
 key constraints—both external and internal—that could affect our workflow.
  By identifying these early, we can:

* Set realistic expectations
* Plan with flexibility
* Encourage transparency

Our goal is to stay aligned, support each other, and build something great—together.

## 🌍 1. External Constraints

*Things out of our control, but not out of our awareness.*

| 🧱 Constraint           | 💬 What It MeansIt                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project Deadlines       | Timelines set by the project supervisor must be
adhered to.                 |
| Internet & Power Issues | Unexpected outages may slow us down—we’ll stay
 flexible and keep each other informed.       |
| Tool Limitations        |Limited to free/public platforms
(e.g., GitHub, Kaggle), which may restrict features.  |
| Data Restrictions       |Only open-access datasets are allowed, licensed or
private data is excluded.    |

## 👥 2. Internal Constraints – Involuntary

*These depend on our personal situations. We didn’t choose them, but we can
manage them!*

| Different Skill Levels | Team members have varying familiarity with GitHub,Data Analysis, ML, etc.—we support peer learning and mentorship. |
| Time Availability |The amount of time available to work on the project may vary from person to person.                        |
| Other Commitments      | Academic, work, or personal commitments that limit availability—we communicate early and plan around it.         |
| Unexpected Life Stuff  | Emergencies, health, or tech issues may arise—we stay transparent and adjust when needed.            |
