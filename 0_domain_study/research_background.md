# 📊 Kickstarter & Crowdfunding Analytics

## 🔎 Research Background

Crowdfunding has revolutionized entrepreneurship by empowering creators to
 bypass traditional financial gatekeepers. Yet, despite its promise, fewer than
  40% of Kickstarter campaigns reach their funding target. Leveraging a rich
   dataset of approximately 375,000 projects (2009–2023), this study models
    campaign success as a function of:

* **Funding Goal**
* **Campaign Duration**

while controlling for variables like project category, launch year, and country.

The findings aim to provide actionable insights that help founders set
 achievable targets and timelines, ultimately informing best practices for both
  creators and platform administrators.
