# Domain Research
# 🎯 Project Overview

This folder contains relevant background information, academic literature, datasets, case studies, our research problem statement, research question, and curated external resources that illuminate the domain of **Entrepreneurship and Crowdfunding**, focusing particularly on **Kickstarter**.

Our project investigates the factors contributing to Kickstarter campaign success, aiming to uncover patterns that can support aspiring entrepreneurs, democratize funding, and foster innovation. This documentation provides a springboard for understanding the ecosystem of crowdfunding.

## ❓ Research Question

**How do the funding goal and the length of the campaign jointly influence the probability that a Kickstarter project will succeed, after controlling for project category, launch year, and country?**

## 🧩 Problem Statement

In many communities, people have creative and impactful ideas that could solve real problems or improve lives. However, these ideas often remain unrealized simply because the individuals behind them don’t have the resources or funding to move forward. Platforms like **Kickstarter** exist to help connect these ideas with people who are willing to support them. 

Yet, many campaigns fail because of unclear goals, poor planning, or a lack of understanding of what makes a campaign successful.

This project aims to study real crowdfunding data to identify the key factors that lead to success, so we can help more people bring their ideas to life and create positive change in their communities. We aim to understand how specific variables such as **funding goal** and **campaign length** interact to affect campaign success, while considering other important attributes.
