# ðŸš€ Kickstarter & Crowdfunding Analytics

Welcome to our domain study on Kickstarter success factors!

ðŸŽ¯ Research Question

> **How do the funding goal and campaign duration jointly influence the
 probability of Kickstarter project success, after controlling for project
 category, launch year, and country?**

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

* ðŸ“„ [Problem Statement](./problem_statement.md)
  Clear definition of the challenge we are investigating.

* ðŸ§  [Problem Brainstorming](./problem_brainstorming.md)
  Initial ideas, divergent and convergent thinking used to refine our research direction.

* ðŸ“š [Research Background & Resources](./research_background.md)
  Concepts, academic literature, industry insights, and key case studies.

---

## ðŸ”¬ Project Goals

* Decode success factors driving crowdfunding outcomes.
* Identify actionable strategies for campaign creators.
* Support data-driven recommendations for platform users.

---

## ðŸ“Š Why Data Analysis Matters in Crowdfunding

Crowdfunding success is influenced by many interconnected factors â€” funding
 goals, campaign duration, project category, country, timing, and creator
  behavior. **Data analysis helps us:**

* **Uncover meaningful correlations:** For example, how goal size and campaign
 length jointly affect success probability.
* **Control for confounding variables:** Like category or country differences,
 ensuring fair comparison across diverse projects.
* **Identify optimal ranges:** Such as recommended funding goals and campaign
 durations for different project types.
* **Spot trends over time:** Analyzing changes in success rates across years or industries.
* **Provide evidence-based recommendations:** Turning complex data into practical
 advice for campaign creators and platform designers.

Without data analysis, decisions are often based on assumptions or anecdotal
 evidence. **By analyzing Kickstarter data systematically, we generate reliable
  insights that empower both creators and platforms to improve outcomes.**

*Stay tuned â€” we continue to refine our analysis and share insights!*
