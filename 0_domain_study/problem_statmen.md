# Research Framework

## ‚ùì Research Question  

**How do funding goals and campaign durations jointly influence success
 probability across different project categories, while controlling for launch
  year and country?**

## üß© Problem Statement  

Kickstarter has transformed entrepreneurial funding by allowing creators to
 bypass traditional gatekeepers. However:  

- **62% of campaigns fail** to reach their funding goals  
- Creators struggle with fundamental decisions:  
  - Setting realistic funding targets  
  - Determining optimal campaign lengths  
  - Adapting strategies to project categories  
- Existing guidance lacks data-driven, category-specific recommendations  

This study analyzes 375,000+ historical campaigns (2009-2023) to identify success
 patterns that can:  

1. Help creators make better launch decisions  
2. Reduce avoidable campaign failures  
3. Improve platform recommendation systems
